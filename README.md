My 20th assignment! It runs off of a database for a theoretical gym with two tables, one for members and one for workout sessions you can schedule. Running the management script will:  

1. Add a dummy member  
2. Search for that member  
3. Add a workout session for the member  
4. Search for the workout session that was made  
5. Delete the workout session that was made  
6. Delete the member

The analysis script will search for any members between two ages, which could be useful for various analytics.
